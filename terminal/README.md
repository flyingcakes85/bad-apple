Simply run `ascii_gen.py` in your terminal.

```sh
python ascii_gen.py
```

The script automatically detects your terminal height and decides the appropriate size for output frames. You will want to reduce x/y offset for your terminal characters to get a smooth look, otherwise adjacent squares will have some space between them. I used [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) which has options for offsetting characters. This was played at 1 frame per 0.750s. Recorded video was then sped up by 2356% to get the output render.

I edited my video using [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/).
